# hitzapp
New version of the hitztourney app, deployed to heroku

Sorry, I haven't updated this since the last time I was unemployed. We still play Hitz, but no longer use this tool to track and determine matchups. The versions of the libraries included have serious vulnerabilities, so I'm leaving this repository up as evidence that I can cobble together web apps but I do not recommend using it as a serious matchmaking tool.
